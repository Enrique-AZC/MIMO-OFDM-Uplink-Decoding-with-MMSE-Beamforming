# MIMO-OFDM-Uplink-Decoding-with-MMSE-Beamforming
This project implements a **MIMO-OFDM uplink decoding system** with **Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) beamforming** at the base station (BS).   The system simulates a **10-antenna BS** receiving uplink transmissions from **3 mobile users**, each transmitting QAM-16 modulated signals.
